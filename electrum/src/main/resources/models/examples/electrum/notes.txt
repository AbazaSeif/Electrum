local state idiom is harder:

sig Msg {
	t : one Tick
}

requires encoding "each Msg is in var t exactly once" (or at most once, ...)

compare two arbitrary states is tough:

some t1 : P[t1] and some t2 : P[t2] then t1.state = t2.state

forcing of loops is sometimes problematic, often more states

some had counter-examples when no loop (mutex), no longer possible in electrum (relevant kind of bugs)
