# Electrum

This extension to the Alloy Analyzer by the [High-Assurance Software Laboratory](http://haslab.di.uminho.pt) provides an analyzer for Electrum models, a temporal extension to the Alloy modeling language.

[Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu/) is a simple structural modeling language based on first-order logic developed at the [Software Design Group](http://sdg.csail.mit.edu/). Its Analyzer can generate instances of invariants, simulate the execution of operations, and check user-specified properties of a model.

Electrum is open-source and available under the [MIT license](LICENSE), as is the Alloy Analyzer. However, it utilizes several third-party packages whose code may be distributed under a different license (see the various LICENSE files in the distribution for details), including [Kodod](https://github.com/emina/kodkod)'s extension [Pardinus](https://github.com/nmacedo/Pardinus) and its underlying solvers ([SAT4J](http://www.sat4j.org), [MiniSat](http://minisat.se), [Glucose/Syrup](http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/), [(P)Lingeling](http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/), and [Yices](http://yices.csl.sri.com)), as well as [CUP](http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/) and [JFlex](http://jflex.de/) to generate the parser.

## Building Electrum

Electrum needs Java 8 and can be built using Maven. The script will also build Kodkod/Pardinus, which uses the [Waf](https://github.com/waf-project/waf) build
system, which requires Python 2.5 or later, and needs a C/C++ compiler for the underlying solvers.

* Clone the Electrum repository, as well as Pardinus' as a submodule 

  `$ git clone -b master --recursive https://github.com/nmacedo/Electrum`  
  `$ cd Electrum`

* Run the Maven script to generate a self containable executable under `electrum/target`. This will compile Electrum and Pardinus, as well as the underlying native libraries (see respective installation [notes](https://github.com/nmacedo/Pardinus)).

 `$  mvn clean package -DskipTests`

## Running

[Download]() the executable ``jar`` (or [build](#building-electrum) it) and launch it simply as

`$ java -jar electrum-runnable.jar`

This will launch Electrum's/Alloy Analyzer's simple GUI, which is packaged with several examples.
